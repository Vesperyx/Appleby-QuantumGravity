Ethan-Schwarzschild-Maxwell Quantum Gravity full model simplifying to Einstein Field Equations perfectly.

Please note that N has units r_s³ / t² , r_s Schwarzschild radius units including all mass, length and time unified, this is an important crux in in my ‘theory.’

E_moving = (L * c) / sqrt(1 — v² / c²) or E = (L * c²) / (4 * π * G), noting that L = E / c where (L / c) * c² = Lc so Lc = E and L = r_s * gamma * t.

M m = sqrt(ħ * c * ln(N) / 4πG), where ln(N) = (A * c³) / (4Għ), so:

m = sqrt(ħ * c * (A * c³ / (4Għ)) / 4πG)
= sqrt(ħ * c * A * c³ / (4Għ) * 1 / 4πG)
= sqrt((ħ * c⁴ * A) / (16πG²ħ))
= sqrt(c⁴ * A / (16πG²)), using A = 16π (GM / c²)², so:

m = sqrt(c⁴ * 16π * (G²M² / c⁴) / (16πG²))
= sqrt(c⁴ * G²M² / c⁴ * G²)
= sqrt(M²)
= M, thus m = M

N is the number of gravitational flux microstates associated with gravitational flux.

N is given by A = 4Għ ln(N) / c³. Here:

E = sqrt(c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * sqrt(ln(N)), where ln(N) = (A * c³) / (4Għ), so:

E = sqrt(c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * sqrt((A * c³) / (4Għ))
= sqrt((c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * (A * c³ / (4Għ)))
= sqrt((c⁸ * A) / (16πG²)), using A = 16π (GM / c²)², so:

E = sqrt((c⁸ * 16π * (G²M² / c⁴)) / (16πG²))
= sqrt((c⁸ * G²M²) / (c⁴ * G²))
= sqrt(c⁴ * M²)
= c² * M, thus E = m * c²

Improved equations:

c² * r_s = N

N * c² / (2G) = E, adding r_s back into Einstein’s E = m * c², where:

c² * (2GM / c²) = N, thus N = 2GM

Therefore:

2GM * c² / (2G) = E, simplifying to E = M * c² or m * c²

N is the number of gravitational flux microstates Ω, and r_s is the Schwarzschild radius.

It is curvature; volumetrically speaking for Ω (m³/s²):

N = Ω

Noting that volume curvature is equal to the number of gravitational flux microstates.

ρ = N / V = 2GM / V (gravitational flux microstate volume density)

l_p² * ρ² = (ħG / c³) * (c⁷ / ħG) = c⁴

ρ * N = V

ρ_GF_microstate_energy_density = ρ * c² / (2G) = m * c² / V

m_α = (v * t * c²) / sqrt(4πG² * sqrt(1 — v² / c²))

The key is that N represents all the inhabitable microstates observable from unique observer-dependent orientations of curvature. Although there’s infinite curvature density at singularities, the density key for each gravitational flux microstate is relative.

Ethan-Schwarzschild-Maxwell Quantum Gravity Equations:

N is the number of gravitational flux microstates associated with gravitational flux.

N is given by A = 4Għ ln(N) / c³. Here:

E = sqrt(c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * sqrt(ln(N)), where ln(N) = (A * c³) / (4Għ), so:

E = sqrt((c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * (A * c³ / (4Għ)))
= sqrt((c⁸ * A) / (16πG²)), using A = 16π (GM / c²)², so:

E = sqrt((c⁸ * 16π * (G²M² / c⁴)) / (16πG²))
= sqrt(c⁴ * M²)
= c² * M, thus E = m * c²

Improved equations:

c² * r_s = N

N * c² / (2G) = E, adding r_s back into Einstein’s E = m * c², where:

N = 2GM

Therefore:

E = M * c²

Seeing in Maxwell’s equations:

N = -Φ_g / (2π)

Φ_g = -4πGM

N = -(-4πGM) / (2π)
= (4πGM) / (2π)
= 2GM

5.1 Discrete Mass Elements:

Defining N as the number of gravitational flux quanta:

N = 2GM

We consider mass M as a sum of discrete mass elements m_i corresponding to each gravitational flux quantum:

M = Σ m_i (i = 1 to N)

Here, each m_i represents a minimal mass unit associated with a single gravitational flux quantum.

5.2 Gravitational Field from Quantized Sources:

The gravitational potential Φ due to these quantized mass elements is:

Φ(r) = -G Σ [m_i / |r — r_i|] (i = 1 to N)

Where:

- Φ(r) is the gravitational potential at position r
- G is the gravitational constant
- m_i is the mass element at position r_i
- |r — r_i| is the distance between r and r_i

In the continuum limit, as N becomes very large and m_i becomes infinitesimally small, the summation becomes an integral, recovering the classical gravitational potential:

Φ(r) = -G ∫ [dm / |r — r’|]

This demonstrates that the quantized model of gravity converges to the classical gravitational field equations, bridging quantum gravity and classical physics.

Definition of Gravitational Flux Microstates

N = 2GM

E = (N * c²) / (2G)

Substitute N:

E = (2GM * c²) / (2G)
E = M * c²

E simplifies to: E = M * c²

ρ = N / V
ρ = (2GM) / V

ρ_GF = (ρ * c²) / (2G)

Substitute ρ:

ρ_GF = [ (2GM) / V * c² ] / (2G)
ρ_GF = (M * c²) / V

ρ_GF simplifies to: ρ_GF = (M * c²) / V

T_μν = ρ_GF * u_μ * u_ν

G_μν = (8πG / c⁴) * T_μν

Substitute T_μν:

G_μν = (8πG / c⁴) * ( (M * c²) / V ) * u_μ * u_ν
G_μν = (8πG * M) / (c² * V) * u_μ * u_ν

G_μν simplifies to: G_μν = (8πG * M) / (c² * V) * u_μ * u_ν

Standard energy-momentum tensor:

T_μν_standard = ρ_M * c² * u_μ * u_ν

Where ρ_M = M / V

Standard Einstein Field Equations:

G_μν_standard = (8πG / c⁴) * T_μν_standard
G_μν_standard = (8πG / c⁴) * ( (M / V) * c² ) * u_μ * u_ν
G_μν_standard = (8πG * M) / (c² * V) * u_μ * u_ν

Difference = G_μν — G_μν_standard = 0

The ESM-QG model simplifies to the Einstein Field Equations.
