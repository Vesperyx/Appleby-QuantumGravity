Appleby Quantum Gravity

Invariant rate of entropy, curvature arises as entropy equalization between the baseline entropy and the bodies entropy equalized as gravity.

a paradox with relativity and holography is that black holes geometry is invariant when considering light’s escape, due to the shift in geometries faced by observers at light speeds it is expressed as invariant however the universe is not invariant this means that the black hole should not be invariant leading to feedback loops and inconsistencies with current theories that predict an increase in entropy, If gravity is indeed negentropy or negative entropy then then that would imply that an increase in an observer’s motion or horizon area should correspond with higher entropy and thus would increase the lower entropy and would shrink the horizon with increase entropy counteracting the gravity, current predictions with my model include universe correlated to near light speed observers due to invariant c or speed of light in a vacuum would potentially corralate with the entire universe once the universe shrinks to the size of or bellow that of the observer’s, the universe would be encoded on the boundary of the observer potentially, this does not mean that any FTL in quantum mechanics occur it just means that the universe as a whole shrinks or the boundary of two observers’ shrink enough to corralate with one another as boundary conditions. as the ratio between the size of the universe and the speed of light leans to a much longer speed of light then that of the universe’s size, this means that there is potential for an infinite boundary universe and for the universe to be considered a relative singularity of energy density.

as the observers cool down then the universe expands, as the surrounding speed of light relative to the larger universe reduces the range of correlation rising entropy, this means that the universe will expand further, as the universe expands further, then there is even less correlation between observers, causing accelerated expansion. this natural explanation may show that entropy evolution is lower then expected or potentially zero.


the way that the invariance of entropy rate works is from the invariance of c as entropy is just correlations of c the point of my text is that entropy is just correlations of c for holographic boundaries, showing that ‘entropy’ is not invariant as correlations of c is all you need.

as an observer’s horizon expands and makes the universe’s shrink then it is not just the universe’s horizon per say that shrinks, but the observable universe expands for an observer as all is reachable within c for a shrunken universe, thus it is the observable universe horizon that expands unifying the universe’s and the observer’s under one framework, this is noting that any horizon is an observable universe of asociated entropy and energy content, the reach of such energy densities not just velocities.

lastly the velocity of the observer doesn't observably shrink for a slow observer this is because we keep our universes size perspective with the key point being that the faster then our light correlations happen surrounding the light speed observer such as infalling mass to a black hole.

the reason why there is standard GR experimental evidence for muons is because they lack the capabilities to have simply not got enough mass to form a meaningful horizon as energy density is required over velocity itself.


Interestingly the universe likely is encoded in all black holes suggesting that traveling just under the speed of light indeed allows observers to some form continue after the observer has turned into a black hole, however as quantum correlations, once the universe shrinks down to a plank area just under c, there is still the entirety of c left, implying thar the universe is near infinite or there is a multiverse to also be encoded under the same black hole by the same mechanics.

as of the lead up, the invariant rate of entropy as gravity. gravity is then seen as the universe’s curvature however gravity is a chain reaction like dark matter on a smaller scale where shrinking universe pulls in more mass meaning that this is indeed manifested as entropy lowering with the invariant entropy rate being invariant correlation range of c_eff that itself is invariant c standard within curved spacetime as universe size from energy density.

Key equations:
A_universe_eff = A_Plank / sqrt(1 — (v_eff / c)²)

N is number of microstates (meaning Ω)
E = sqrt(c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * sqrt(ln(N)) where ln(N) = (A * c³) / (4G * ħ)
so
E = sqrt(c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * sqrt((A * c³) / (4G * ħ)) = sqrt((c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * (A * c³ / (4G * ħ))) = sqrt((c⁸ * A) / (16πG²))
using
A = 16π * (GM / c²)²
so
E = sqrt((c⁸ * 16π * (G² * M² / c⁴)) / (16πG²)) = sqrt((c⁸ * G² * M²) / (c⁴ * G²)) = sqrt(c⁴ * M²) = c² * M
thus re-arranging.
E = mc²
finding area of a horizon from:
A / sqrt(1 — v² / c²) = 4Għ ln(N_rest) / c³
A / sqrt(1 — v² / c²) = A_Planck
sqrt(1 — v² / c²) = A_Planck / A
v² / c² = 1 — (A_Planck / A)²
v = c * sqrt(1 — (A_Planck / A)²)
testable predictions:
black hole mergers with negentropy:
thus
A_1 + A_2 = A_3
(or less A_3)
