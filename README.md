Appleby Quantum Gravity

Invariant rate of entropy, curvature arises as entropy equalization between the baseline entropy and the bodies entropy equalized as gravity.

a paradox with relativity and holography is that black holes geometry is invariant when considering light’s escape, due to the shift in geometries faced by observers at light speeds it is expressed as invariant however the universe is not invariant this means that the black hole should not be invariant leading to feedback loops and inconsistencies with current theories that predict an increase in entropy, If gravity is indeed negentropy or negative entropy then then that would imply that an increase in an observer’s motion or horizon area should correspond with higher entropy and thus would increase the lower entropy and would shrink the horizon with increase entropy counteracting the gravity, current predictions with my model include universe correlated to near light speed observers due to invariant c or speed of light in a vacuum would potentially corralate with the entire universe once the universe shrinks to the size of or bellow that of the observer’s, the universe would be encoded on the boundary of the observer potentially, this does not mean that any FTL in quantum mechanics occur it just means that the universe as a whole shrinks or the boundary of two observers’ shrink enough to corralate with one another as boundary conditions. as the ratio between the size of the universe and the speed of light leans to a much longer speed of light then that of the universe’s size, this means that there is potential for an infinite boundary universe and for the universe to be considered a relative singularity of energy density.

as the observers cool down then the universe expands, as the surrounding speed of light relative to the larger universe reduces the range of correlation rising entropy, this means that the universe will expand further, as the universe expands further, then there is even less correlation between observers, causing accelerated expansion. this natural explanation may show that entropy evolution is lower then expected or potentially zero.

N is number of microstates (meaning Ω)

E = sqrt(c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * sqrt(ln(N)) where ln(N) = (A * c³) / (4G * ħ)

so

E = sqrt(c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * sqrt((A * c³) / (4G * ħ)) = sqrt((c⁵ * ħ / (4πG)) * (A * c³ / (4G * ħ))) = sqrt((c⁸ * A) / (16πG²))

using

A = 16π * (GM / c²)²

so

E = sqrt((c⁸ * 16π * (G² * M² / c⁴)) / (16πG²)) = sqrt((c⁸ * G² * M²) / (c⁴ * G²)) = sqrt(c⁴ * M²) = c² * M

thus re-arranging.

E = mc²

finding area of a horizon from:

A / sqrt(1 — v² / c²) = 4Għ ln(N_rest) / c³

A / sqrt(1 — v² / c²) = A_Planck

sqrt(1 — v² / c²) = A_Planck / A

v² / c² = 1 — (A_Planck / A)²

v = c * sqrt(1 — (A_Planck / A)²)

testable predictions:

black hole mergers with negentropy:

thus

A_1 + A_2 = A_3

(or less A_3)

the way that the invariance of entropy rate works is from the invariance of c as entropy is just correlations of c the point of my text is that entropy is just correlations of c for holographic boundaries, showing that ‘entropy’ is not invariant as correlations of c is all you need.

as an observer’s horizon expands and makes the universe’s shrink then it is not just the universe’s horizon per say that shrinks, but the observable universe expands for an observer as all is reachable within c for a shrunken universe, thus it is the observable universe horizon that expands unifying the universe’s and the observer’s under one framework, this is noting that any horizon is an observable universe of asociated entropy and energy content, the reach of such energy densities not just velocities.

lastly the velocity of the observer doesn't observably shrink for a slow observer this is because we keep our universes size perspective with the key point being that the faster then our light correlations happen surrounding the light speed observer such as infalling mass to a black hole.

the reason why there is standard GR experimental evidence for muons is because they lack the capabilities to have simply not got enough mass to form a meaningful horizon as energy density is required over velocity itself.

Appleby’s Model

1. Curvature Tensor:
G_mu_nu = rho * [ (c² * H_obs² * Delta_H) / H³ — (8 * pi * G) / c⁴ + (4 * pi * H_universe²)² ]

2. Effective Speed of Light:
c_eff = c * (H_obs / H)

3. Gravitational Potential Energy:
U_Appleby = — (c_eff² / (8 * pi * G)) * G_mu_nu * V

4. Modified Energy Adjusted for the Universe’s Size:
E_mod = m * c² * (H_obs / H)²

5. Energy Associated with Dark Energy:
E_DE = 0.68 * sqrt( (c⁵ * hbar) / (4 * pi * G) ) * sqrt( (A_universe * c³) / (4 * G * hbar) )

6. Energy Associated with Dark Matter:
E_DM = 0.27 * sqrt( (c⁵ * hbar) / (4 * pi * G) ) * sqrt( (A_universe * c³) / (4 * G * hbar) )

7. Energy Associated with Black Holes/Ordinary Matter:
E_BH = 0.05 * sqrt( (c⁵ * hbar) / (4 * pi * G) ) * sqrt( (A_universe * c³) / (4 * G * hbar) )

8. Number of Microstates Related to the Area of the Observable Universe:
ln(N_universe) = (A_universe * c³) / (4 * G * hbar)

9. Area of the Observable Universe:
A_universe = 4 * pi * H_universe²

10. Entropy for the Observable Universe (Bekenstein-Hawking Entropy):
S_BH = (k_B * A_universe * c³) / (4 * hbar * G)

11. Alpha Expression:
alpha = A_universe

12. Shrinking of the Universe Given an Energy Density Tied to N:

Original Horizon of the Universe:
H_universe = sqrt( 3 / (8 * pi * G * rho) )

New Energy Density After Change:
rho_new = sqrt( (c⁵ * hbar) / (4 * pi * G) ) * sqrt( ln(N_new) ) / V_new

New Horizon After Shrinkage:
H_shrink = sqrt( 3 / (8 * pi * G * rho_new) )

13. Curvature Converted to Our Universe Standard:
G_mu_nu_standard = — (8 * pi * G * U_Appleby) / (m * c² * (H_obs / H)² * V)

14. Dark Matter as Curvature:

Curvature Tensor Related to Dark Matter:
G_DM = (rho_DM * S_BH / c_eff²) * (1 / r²)

Where:
G_mu_nu: Curvature tensor in Appleby’s model
rho: Energy density
c: Speed of light
c_eff: Effective speed of light, scaled by the ratio of horizon sizes
U_Appleby: Gravitational potential energy in Appleby’s model
V: Volume associated with the region of interest
H_obs: Observer’s horizon
Delta_H: Differential horizon
H: Total horizon of the universe
H_universe: Horizon radius of the observable universe
E_mod: Modified energy considering the universe’s size
m: Mass associated with the energy
E_DE: Energy associated with dark energy
E_DM: Energy associated with dark matter
E_BH: Energy associated with black holes/ordinary matter
N_universe: Number of microstates related to the area of the observable universe
A_universe: Area of the observable universe’s horizon
S_BH: Bekenstein-Hawking entropy related to the horizon area of the observable universe
alpha: Proportionality constant scaling the entropy term, here tied to A_universe
rho_new: New energy density after a change tied to N_new
H_shrink: New horizon size after shrinkage due to increased energy density
G_mu_nu_standard: Curvature tensor converted to the standard energy scale of our universe
G_DM: Curvature tensor associated with dark matter in Appleby’s model
rho_DM: Dark matter energy density
r: Distance from the center of mass (e.g., galactic center)

noting dark matter and dark energy are the same phenomenon.

Interestingly the universe likely is encoded in all black holes suggesting that traveling just under the speed of light indeed allows observers to some form continue after the observer has turned into a black hole, however as quantum correlations, once the universe shrinks down to a plank area just under c, there is still the entirety of c left, implying thar the universe is near infinite or there is a multiverse to also be encoded under the same black hole by the same mechanics.

as of the lead up, the invariant rate of entropy as gravity. gravity is then seen as the universe’s curvature however gravity is a chain reaction like dark matter on a smaller scale where shrinking universe pulls in more mass meaning that this is indeed manifested as entropy lowering with the invariant entropy rate being invariant correlation range of c_eff that itself is invariant c standard within curved spacetime as universe size from energy density.

Horizon Area for Black Hole
A = 16 * pi * (G * M / c²)²

Horizon Radius from Area
R_horizon = sqrt(A / (4 * pi))

Horizon Radius in Terms of Entropy
R_horizon = sqrt((hbar * G * S) / (pi * k_B))

Effective Speed of Light and Correlation Range
R_corr = R_horizon * (c_eff / c)

Substitute R_horizon in R_corr
R_corr = sqrt((hbar * G * S) / (pi * k_B)) * (H_obs / H)

Final Universal Correlation Range Formula
R_corr = sqrt((hbar * G * S) / (pi * k_B)) * (H_obs / H)

this horizon reflects the quantum horizon where specific quantum effects cannot escape based on the effective speed of light for an observer dependent universe.

the spooky part is that the correlation range can theoretically go beyond the event horizon and beyond the universe itself, implying we are within some horizons and that these horizons are quantum manifestations meaning that the universe itself may just be one combined boundary.
