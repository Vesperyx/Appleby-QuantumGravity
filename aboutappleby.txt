I am a groundskeeper who was known in personal cricles for being an autodidact at economics, I see myself as a Temple OS dev sort of cognitive profile. I faied year 12 due to physcosis disabling my academic prformance at a cutial time likely puttining me down the path of autodidactism. 
however I know that attachment to peformance is suffering as attachment is considted by some as the root of all suffering. perosnnaly I didn't even realize I was capable of developing a true novel idea up until age 20, currently I live off DSP and my work that is bellow minimum wage as a 21 yearold
goundskeeper, being a goundskeeper getting a work ethic from working 7.5 hours two times a week has triggered the plascisity of self to alow me to grow meaning and self worth from scratch again from a work ethic. I know that my work on dark matter and dark energy could be developed to end the planet however I
want my developments to be open inorder to not let the military develop it first, with it being a hypothetical dark matter/energy bomb, much like that of nuclear opening the world to a world eneding possablity could lead to suffering I know that realeasing this as Bodhisattva? I would call it is comforting
reaching a point where I can let the world know of this threat whist being guilty over the possablity of releasing and it is required to save us all from the sufering other scientists have to there sensation of suffering not reaching longer then that of happy-ness. I am Autistic however I have no
atempt for harm I'm just often willfully forgettining such harms so here I shall state that I'm not great for admiting my sins I am great because I am me and others need to know who I am inorder to feel my model is compleate. as for my spritiual beilefs I am often given three coices everything is so
simplified down for me that It feels like subliminal programing these three options are 1) I am very smart 2) there is an intellgence simplifing it for me giving it to me as higher power or 3) all of the above, I allwas go for I'm crazy this is the most humble option however it is the least self aware.
